    <h1>Sandro Botticelli</h1>
   
</div>
<div class="blog">
    <p>Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi (c. 1445[1] – May 17, 1510), known as Sandro Botticelli (/ˌboʊtiˈtʃɛli/,
    Italian: [ˈsandro bottiˈtʃɛlli]), was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance. Botticelli's posthumous reputation
    suffered until the late 19th century, when he was rediscovered by the Pre-Raphaelites who stimulated a reappraisal of
    his work. Since then, his paintings have been seen to represent the linear grace of late Italian Gothic and some Early
    Renaissance painting, even though they date from the latter half of the Italian Renaissance period.
    
    In addition to the mythological subjects for which he is best known today, Botticelli painted a wide range of religious
    subjects (including dozens of renditions of the Madonna and Child, many in the round tondo shape) and also some
    portraits. His best-known works are The Birth of Venus and Primavera, both in the Uffizi in Florence, which holds many
    of Botticelli’s works.[5] Botticelli lived all his life in the same neighbourhood of Florence; his only significant
    times elsewhere were the months he spent painting in Pisa in 1474 and the Sistine Chapel in Rome in 1481–82.[6]
    
    Only one of Botticelli's paintings, the Mystic Nativity (National Gallery, London) is inscribed with a date (1501), but
    others can be dated with varying degrees of certainty on the basis of archival records, so the development of his style
    can be traced with some confidence. He was an independent master for all the 1470s, which saw his reputation soar. The
    1480s were his most successful decade, the one in which his large mythological paintings were completed along with many
    of his most famous Madonnas. By the 1490s his style became more personal and to some extent mannered. His last works
    show him moving in a direction opposite to that of Leonardo da Vinci (seven years his junior) and the new generation of
    painters creating the High Renaissance style, and instead returning to a style that many have described as more Gothic
    or "archaic."

    <h1>Sistine Chapel</h1>

        <p>in 1481, Pope Sixtus IV summoned Botticelli and other prominent Florentine and Umbrian artists to fresco the walls of
            the newly completed Sistine Chapel. This large project was to be the main decoration of the chapel. Botticelli
            painted a series of portraits of popes.[33] These works were called Temptation of Moses, Temptation of Christ, and
            Conturbation of the Laws of Moses.[5] Most of the frescos remain but are greatly overshadowed and disrupted by
            Michelangelo's work of the next century, as some of the earlier frescos were destroyed to make room for his
            paintings.[34] The Florentine contribution is thought to be part of a peace deal between Lorenzo Medici and the
            papacy. After Sixtus was implicated in the Pazzi conspiracy hostilities had escalated into excommunication for
            Lorenzo and other Florentine officials and a small "Pazzi War".[35]
            The iconographic scheme was a pair of cycles, facing each other on the sides of the chapel, of the Life of Christ and
            the Life of Moses, together suggesting the supremacy of the Papacy. Botticelli's contribution included three of the
            original fourteen large scenes: the Temptations of Christ, Youth of Moses and Punishment of the Sons of Corah (or
            various other titles),[36] as well as several of the imagined portraits of popes in the level above, and paintings of
            unknown subjects in the lunettes above, where Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling now is. He may have also done a
            fourth scene on the end wall opposite the altar, now destroyed.[37] Each painter brought a team of assistants from his
            workshop, as the space to be covered was considerable; each of the main panels is some 3.5 by 5.7 metres, and the work
            was done in a few months.

<p>The masterpieces Primavera (c. 1482) and The Birth of Venus (c. 1485) are not a pair, but are inevitably discussed
together; both are in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the Italian
Renaissance. As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented
in Western art since classical antiquity. Together with the smaller and less celebrated Venus and Mars and Pallas and
the Centaur, they have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient
painters and the context of wedding celebrations, the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism, and the identity of the
commissioners and possible models for the figures.[47]

Though all carry differing degrees of complexity in their meanings, they also have an immediate visual appeal that
accounts for their enormous popularity. All show dominant and beautiful female figures in an idyllic world of feeling,
with a sexual element. Continuing scholarly attention mainly focuses on the poetry and philosophy of contemporary
Renaissance humanists. The works do not illustrate particular texts; rather, each relies upon several texts for its
significance. Their beauty was characterized by Vasari as exemplifying "grace" and by John Ruskin as possessing linear
rhythm. The pictures feature Botticelli's linear style at its most effective, emphasized by the soft continual contours
and pastel colours.[48]

The Primavera and the Birth were both seen by Vasari in the mid-16th century at the Villa di Castello, owned from 1477
by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, and until the publication in 1975 of a Medici inventory of 1499,[49] it was
assumed that both works were painted specifically for the villa. Recent scholarship suggests otherwise: the Primavera,
also known as the Allegory of Spring, was painted for Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's townhouse in Florence, and The Birth of
Venus was commissioned by someone else for a different site.[5][50]


Venus and Mars, c. 1485, tempera on panel, 69 cm × 173 cm (27.17 in × 68.11 in), National Gallery, London
Botticelli painted only a small number of mythological subjects, but these are now probably his best known works. A much
smaller panel than those discussed before is his Venus and Mars in the National Gallery, London. This was of a size and
shape to suggest that it was a spalliera, a painting made to fitted into either furniture, or more likely in this case,
wood panelling. The wasps buzzing around Mars' head suggest that it may have been painted for a member of his neighbours
the Vespucci family, whose name means "little wasps" in Italian, and who featured wasps in their coat of arms. Mars lies
asleep, presumably after lovemaking, while Venus watches as infant satyrs play with his military gear, and one tries to
rouse him by blowing a conch shell in his ear. The painting was no doubt given to celebrate a marriage, and decorate the
bedchamber.[51]

Three of these four large mythologies feature Venus, a central figure in Renaissance Neoplatonism, which gave divine
love as important a place in its philosophy as did Christianity. The fourth, Pallas and the Centaur is clearly connected
with the Medici by the symbol on Pallas' dress. The Pallas and the Centaur was another painting that was painted for
Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici.[5] The two figures are roughly life-size, and a number of specific personal,
political or philosophic interpretations have been proposed to expand on the basic meaning of the submission of passion
to reason.[52]

A series of panels in the form of an spalliera or cassone were commissioned from Botticelli by Antonio Pucci in 1483 on
the occasion of the marriage of his son Giannozzo with Lucrezia Bini. The subject was the story of' Nastagio degli
Onesti from the eighth novel of the fifth day of Boccaccio's Decameron, in four panels. The coats of arms of the Medici
and the bride and groom's families appear in the third panel.[53]</p>
