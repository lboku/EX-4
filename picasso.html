    <h1>Pablo Picasso</h1>
   
</div>
<div class="blog">
    <p>Pablo Ruiz Picasso[a][b] (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and
    theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he
    is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture,[8][9] the co-invention of collage,
    and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist
    Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of
    Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.
    
    Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through his
    childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with
    different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse motivated
    Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were
    often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.[10][11][12][13]
    
    Picasso's work is often categorized into periods. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most
    commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901–1904), the Rose Period (1904–1906), the
    African-influenced Period (1907–1909), Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919), also referred to
    as the Crystal period. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and his work
    in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.
    
    Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for
    his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.

    <h1>Career</h1>
        <div class="blog">
            <img class="image" src="./img/Picasso in 1904.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>Picasso's training under his father began before 1890. His progress can be traced in the collection of early works now
        held by the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, which provides one of the most comprehensive records extant of any major
        artist's beginnings.[23] During 1893 the juvenile quality of his earliest work falls away, and by 1894 his career as a
        painter can be said to have begun.[24] The academic realism apparent in the works of the mid-1890s is well displayed in
        The First Communion (1896), a large composition that depicts his sister, Lola. In the same year, at the age of 14, he
        painted Portrait of Aunt Pepa, a vigorous and dramatic portrait that Juan-Eduardo Cirlot has called "without a doubt one
        of the greatest in the whole history of Spanish painting."[25]
        
        In 1897, his realism began to show a Symbolist influence, for example, in a series of landscape paintings rendered in
        non-naturalistic violet and green tones. What some call his Modernist period (1899–1900) followed. His exposure to the
        work of Rossetti, Steinlen, Toulouse-Lautrec and Edvard Munch, combined with his admiration for favourite old masters
        such as El Greco, led Picasso to a personal version of modernism in his works of this period.[26]
        
        Picasso made his first trip to Paris, then the art capital of Europe, in 1900. There, he met his first Parisian friend,
        journalist and poet Max Jacob, who helped Picasso learn the language and its literature. Soon they shared an apartment;
        Max slept at night while Picasso slept during the day and worked at night. These were times of severe poverty, cold, and
        desperation. Much of his work was burned to keep the small room warm. During the first five months of 1901, Picasso
        lived in Madrid, where he and his anarchist friend Francisco de Asís Soler founded the magazine Arte Joven (Young Art),
        which published five issues. Soler solicited articles and Picasso illustrated the journal, mostly contributing grim
        cartoons depicting and sympathizing with the state of the poor. The first issue was published on 31 March 1901, by which
        time the artist had started to sign his work Picasso.[27] From 1898 he signed his works as "Pablo Ruiz Picasso", then as
        "Pablo R. Picasso" until 1901. The change does not seem to imply a rejection of the father figure. Rather, he wanted to
        distinguish himself from others; initiated by his Catalan friends who habitually called him by his maternal surname,
        much less current than the paternal Ruiz.

<p>Analytic cubism (1909–1912) is a style of painting Picasso developed with Georges Braque using monochrome brownish and
neutral colours. Both artists took apart objects and "analyzed" them in terms of their shapes. Picasso and Braque's
paintings at this time share many similarities.

In Paris, Picasso entertained a distinguished coterie of friends in the Montmartre and Montparnasse quarters, including
André Breton, poet Guillaume Apollinaire, writer Alfred Jarry and Gertrude Stein. In 1911, Picasso was arrested and
questioned about the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. Suspicion for the crime had initially fallen upon
Apollinaire due to his links to Géry Pieret, an artist with a history of thefts from the gallery. Apollinaire in turn
implicated his close friend Picasso, who had also purchased stolen artworks from the artist in the past. Afraid of a
conviction that could result in his deportation to Spain, Picasso denied having ever met Apollinaire. Both were later
cleared of any involvement in the painting's disappearance.[39][40]

Synthetic cubism: 1912–1919
Main article: Crystal Cubism

Synthetic cubism (1912–1919) was a further development of the genre of cubism, in which cut paper fragments – often
wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages – were pasted into compositions, marking the first use of collage in fine art.

Between 1915 and 1917, Picasso began a series of paintings depicting highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects,
consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional element of collage. "Hard-edged square-cut
diamonds", notes art historian John Richardson, "these gems do not always have upside or downside".[41][42] "We need a
new name to designate them," wrote Picasso to Gertrude Stein. The term "Crystal Cubism" was later used as a result of
visual analogies with crystals at the time.[43][41][44] These "little gems" may have been produced by Picasso in
response to critics who had claimed his defection from the movement, through his experimentation with classicism within
the so-called return to order following the war.[41][43]

After acquiring some fame and fortune, Picasso left Olivier for Marcelle Humbert, whom he called Eva Gouel. Picasso
included declarations of his love for Eva in many Cubist works. Picasso was devastated by her premature death from
illness at the age of 30 in 1915.[45]

At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Picasso was living in Avignon. Braque and Derain were mobilized and
Apollinaire joined the French artillery, while the Spaniard Juan Gris remained from the Cubist circle. During the war,
Picasso was able to continue painting uninterrupted, unlike his French comrades. His paintings became more sombre and
his life changed with dramatic consequences. Kahnweiler's contract had terminated on his exile from France. At this
point Picasso's work would be taken on by the art dealer Léonce Rosenberg. After the loss of Eva Gouel, Picasso had an
affair with Gaby Lespinasse. During the spring of 1916, Apollinaire returned from the front wounded. They renewed their
friendship, but Picasso began to frequent new social circles.[46]

Further information: Picasso and the Ballets Russes
Towards the end of World War I, Picasso became involved with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Among his friends during
this period were Jean Cocteau, Jean Hugo, Juan Gris, and others. In the summer of 1918, Picasso married Olga Khokhlova,
a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev's troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Erik Satie's Parade, in Rome; they
spent their honeymoon near Biarritz in the villa of glamorous Chilean art patron Eugenia Errázuriz.

After returning from his honeymoon and in need of money, Picasso started his exclusive relationship with the
French-Jewish art dealer Paul Rosenberg. As part of his first duties, Rosenberg agreed to rent the couple an apartment
in Paris at his own expense, which was located next to his own house. This was the start of a deep brother-like
friendship between two very different men, that would last until the outbreak of World War II.

Khokhlova introduced Picasso to high society, formal dinner parties, and other dimensions of the life of the rich in
1920s Paris. The two had a son, Paulo Picasso,[47] who would grow up to be a motorcycle racer and chauffeur to his
father. Khokhlova's insistence on social propriety clashed with Picasso's bohemian tendencies and the two lived in a
state of constant conflict. During the same period that Picasso collaborated with Diaghilev's troupe, he and Igor
Stravinsky collaborated on Pulcinella in 1920. Picasso took the opportunity to make several drawings of the
composer.[48]

In 1927, Picasso met 17-year-old Marie-Thérèse Walter and began a secret affair with her. Picasso's marriage to
Khokhlova soon ended in separation rather than divorce, as French law required an even division of property in the case
of divorce, and Picasso did not want Khokhlova to have half his wealth. The two remained legally married until
Khokhlova's death in 1955. Picasso carried on a long-standing affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter and fathered a daughter
with her, named Maya. Marie-Thérèse lived in the vain hope that Picasso would one day marry her, and hanged herself four
years after Picasso's death.</p>
