    <h1>Edvard Munch</h1>
   
</div>
<div class="blog">
    <p>Edvard Munch (/mʊŋk/ MUUNK,[1] Norwegian: [ˈɛ̀dvɑɖ ˈmʊŋk] (listen); 12 December 1863 – 23 January 1944) was a Norwegian
    painter. His best known work, The Scream (1893), has become one of Western art's most iconic images.
    
    His childhood was overshadowed by illness, bereavement and the dread of inheriting a mental condition that ran in the
    family. Studying at the Royal School of Art and Design in Kristiania (today's Oslo), Munch began to live a bohemian life
    under the influence of the nihilist Hans Jæger, who urged him to paint his own emotional and psychological state ('soul
    painting'). From this emerged his distinctive style.
    
    Travel brought new influences and outlets. In Paris, he learned much from Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and Henri de
    Toulouse-Lautrec, especially their use of color. In Berlin, he met the Swedish dramatist August Strindberg, whom he
    painted, as he embarked on a major series of paintings he would later call The Frieze of Life, depicting a series of
    deeply-felt themes such as love, anxiety, jealousy and betrayal, steeped in atmosphere.
    
    The Scream was conceived in Kristiania. According to Munch, he was out walking at sunset, when he 'heard the enormous,
    infinite scream of nature'. The painting's agonized face is widely identified with the angst of the modern person.
    Between 1893 and 1910, he made two painted versions and two in pastels, as well as a number of prints. One of the
    pastels would eventually command the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at auction.
    
    As his fame and wealth grew, his emotional state remained insecure. He briefly considered marriage, but could not commit
    himself. A mental breakdown in 1908 forced him to give up heavy drinking, and he was cheered by his increasing
    acceptance by the people of Kristiania and exposure in the city's museums. His later years were spent working in peace
    and privacy. Although his works were banned in Nazi-occupied Europe, most of them survived World War II, securing him a
    legacy.

    <h1>Studies and influences</h1>
        <div class="blog">
            <img class="image" src="./img/Self-Portrait with Skeleton Arm,.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>In 1879, Munch enrolled in a technical college to study engineering, where he excelled in physics, chemistry and
        mathematics. He learned scaled and perspective drawing, but frequent illnesses interrupted his studies.[10] The
        following year, much to his father's disappointment, Munch left the college determined to become a painter. His father
        viewed art as an "unholy trade", and his neighbors reacted bitterly and sent him anonymous letters.[11] In contrast to
        his father's rabid pietism, Munch adopted an undogmatic stance towards art. He wrote his goal in his diary: "In my art I
        attempt to explain life and its meaning to myself."[10]
        
        In 1881, Munch enrolled at the Royal School of Art and Design of Kristiania, one of whose founders was his distant
        relative Jacob Munch. His teachers were the sculptor Julius Middelthun and the naturalistic painter Christian Krohg.[12]
        That year, Munch demonstrated his quick absorption of his figure training at the academy in his first portraits,
        including one of his father and his first self-portrait. In 1883, Munch took part in his first public exhibition and
        shared a studio with other students.[13] His full-length portrait of Karl Jensen-Hjell, a notorious bohemian-about-town,
        earned a critic's dismissive response: "It is impressionism carried to the extreme. It is a travesty of art."[14]
        Munch's nude paintings from this period survive only in sketches, except for Standing Nude (1887). They may have been
        confiscated by his father.[15]
        
        Impressionism inspired Munch from a young age.[16] During these early years, he experimented with many styles, including
        Naturalism and Impressionism. Some early works are reminiscent of Manet. Many of these attempts brought him unfavorable
        criticism from the press and garnered him constant rebukes by his father, who nonetheless provided him with small sums
        for living expenses.[14] At one point, however, Munch's father, perhaps swayed by the negative opinion of Munch's cousin
        Edvard Diriks (an established, traditional painter), destroyed at least one painting (likely a nude) and refused to
        advance any more money for art supplies.[17]
        
        Munch also received his father's ire for his relationship with Hans Jæger, the local nihilist who lived by the code "a
        passion to destroy is also a creative passion" and who advocated suicide as the ultimate way to freedom.[18] Munch came
        under his malevolent, anti-establishment spell. "My ideas developed under the influence of the bohemians or rather under
        Hans Jæger. Many people have mistakenly claimed that my ideas were formed under the influence of Strindberg and the
        Germans … but that is wrong. They had already been formed by then."[19] At that time, contrary to many of the other
        bohemians, Munch was still respectful of women, as well as reserved and well-mannered, but he began to give in to the
        binge drinking and brawling of his circle. He was unsettled by the sexual revolution going on at the time and by the
        independent women around him. He later turned cynical concerning sexual matters, expressed not only in his behavior and
        his art, but in his writings as well, an example being a long poem called The City of Free Love.[20] Still dependent on
        his family for many of his meals, Munch's relationship with his father remained tense over concerns about his bohemian
        life.
        
        After numerous experiments, Munch concluded that the Impressionist idiom did not allow sufficient expression. He found
        it superficial and too akin to scientific experimentation. He felt a need to go deeper and explore situations brimming
        with emotional content and expressive energy. Under Jæger's commandment that Munch should "write his life", meaning that
        Munch should explore his own emotional and psychological state, the young artist began a period of reflection and
        self-examination, recording his thoughts in his "soul's diary".[21] This deeper perspective helped move him to a new
        view of his art. He wrote that his painting The Sick Child (1886), based on his sister's death, was his first "soul
        painting", his first break from Impressionism. The painting received a negative response from critics and from his
        family, and caused another "violent outburst of moral indignation" from the community.[22]
        
        Only his friend Christian Krohg defended him:
        
        He paints, or rather regards, things in a way that is different from that of other artists. He sees only the essential,
        and that, naturally, is all he paints. For this reason Munch's pictures are as a rule "not complete", as people are so
        delighted to discover for themselves. Oh, yes, they are complete. His complete handiwork. Art is complete once the
        artist has really said everything that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of
        the other generation, that he really knows how to show us what he has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he
        subordinates everything else.[23]

<p>In 1896, Munch moved to Paris, where he focused on graphic representations of his Frieze of Life themes. He further
developed his woodcut and lithographic technique. Munch's Self-Portrait with Skeleton Arm (1895) is done with an etching
needle-and-ink method also used by Paul Klee.[65] Munch also produced multi-colored versions of The Sick Child,
concerning tuberculosis, which sold well, as well as several nudes and multiple versions of Kiss (1892).[65] In May
1896, Siegfried Bing held an exhibition of Munch's work inside Bing's Maison de l'Art Nouveau. The exhibition displayed
60 works, including The Kiss, The Scream, Madonna, The Sick Child, The Death Chamber, and The Day After. Bing's
exhibition helped to introduce Munch to a French audience.[66] Still, many of the Parisian critics still considered
Munch's work "violent and brutal" even if his exhibitions received serious attention and good attendance.[67] His
financial situation improved considerably and, in 1897, Munch bought himself a summer house facing the fjords of
Kristiania, a small fisherman's cabin built in the late 18th century, in the small town of Åsgårdstrand in Norway. He
dubbed this home the "Happy House" and returned here almost every summer for the next 20 years.[68] It was this place he
missed when he was abroad and when he felt depressed and exhausted. "To walk in Åsgårdstrand is like walking among my
paintings—I get so inspired to paint when I am here".


Harald Nørregaard (painted by Munch in 1899, National Gallery) was one of Munch's closest friends since adolescence,
adviser and lawyer[69]
In 1897 Munch returned to Kristiania, where he also received grudging acceptance—one critic wrote, "A fair number of
these pictures have been exhibited before. In my opinion these improve on acquaintance."[68] In 1899, Munch began an
intimate relationship with Tulla Larsen, a "liberated" upper-class woman. They traveled to Italy together and upon
returning, Munch began another fertile period in his art, which included landscapes and his final painting in "The
Frieze of Life" series, The Dance of Life (1899).[70] Larsen was eager for marriage, but Munch was not. His drinking and
poor health reinforced his fears, as he wrote in the third person: "Ever since he was a child he had hated marriage. His
sick and nervous home had given him the feeling that he had no right to get married."[71] Munch almost gave in to Tulla,
but fled from her in 1900, also turning away from her considerable fortune, and moved to Berlin.[71] His Girls on the
Jetty, created in 18 different versions, demonstrated the theme of feminine youth without negative connotations.[62] In
1902, he displayed his works thematically at the hall of the Berlin Secession, producing "a symphonic effect—it made a
great stir—a lot of antagonism—and a lot of approval."[72] The Berlin critics were beginning to appreciate Munch's work
even though the public still found his work alien and strange.

The good press coverage gained Munch the attention of influential patrons Albert Kollman and Max Linde. He described the
turn of events in his diary, "After 20 years of struggle and misery forces of good finally come to my aid in Germany—and
a bright door opens up for me."[73] However, despite this positive change, Munch's self-destructive and erratic behavior
led him first to a violent quarrel with another artist, then to an accidental shooting in the presence of Tulla Larsen,
who had returned for a brief reconciliation, which injured two of his fingers. Munch later sawed a self-portrait
depicting him and Larsen in half as a consequence of the shooting and subsequent events.[74] She finally left him and
married a younger colleague of Munch. Munch took this as a betrayal, and he dwelled on the humiliation for some time to
come, channeling some of the bitterness into new paintings.[75] His paintings Still Life (The Murderess) and The Death
of Marat I, done in 1906–07, clearly reference the shooting incident and the emotional after-effects.[76]

In 1903–04, Munch exhibited in Paris where the coming Fauvists, famous for their boldly false colors, likely saw his
works and might have found inspiration in them. When the Fauves held their own exhibit in 1906, Munch was invited and
displayed his works with theirs.[77] After studying the sculpture of Rodin, Munch may have experimented with plasticine
as an aid to design, but he produced little sculpture.[78] During this time, Munch received many commissions for
portraits and prints which improved his usually precarious financial condition.[79] In 1906, he painted the screen for
an Ibsen play in the small Kammerspiele Theatre located in Berlin's Deutsches Theater, in which the Frieze of Life was
hung. The theatre's director Max Reinhardt later sold it; it is now in the Berlin Nationalgalerie.[80] After an earlier
period of landscapes, in 1907 he turned his attention again to human figures and situations</p>
