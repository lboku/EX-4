    <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləm vɑŋ ˈɣɔx] (listen);[note 1] 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch
    Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures in Western art
    history. In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the
    last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by
    bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Not
    commercially successful in his career, he struggled with severe depression and poverty, which eventually led to his
    suicide at age thirty-seven.
    
    Born into an upper-middle class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet, and thoughtful. As a young man,
    he worked as an art dealer, often traveling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to
    religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in predominantly Roman Catholic southern Belgium. He drifted in ill
    health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo
    supported him financially; the two kept a long correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still lifes and
    depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he
    moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting
    against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local
    landscapes. His paintings grew brighter as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in
    the South of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, wheat
    fields and sunflowers.
    
    Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability, he often
    neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a
    confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals,
    including a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near
    Paris, he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression persisted, and on 27 July 1890, Van
    Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest with a revolver, dying from his injuries two days later.
    
    Van Gogh was commercially unsuccessful during his lifetime, and he was considered a madman and a failure. As he became
    famous only after his suicide, he came to be seen as a misunderstood genius in the public imagination.[6] His reputation
    grew in the early 20th century as elements of his style came to be incorporated by the Fauves and German Expressionists.
    He attained widespread critical and commercial success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but
    tragic painter whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist. Today, Van Gogh's works
    are among the world's most expensive paintings to have ever sold, and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name,
    the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.

        <p>iVincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province of North
        Brabant in the Netherlands.[23] He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh (1822–1885), a minister of the
        Dutch Reformed Church, and his wife, Anna Cornelia Carbentus (1819–1907). Van Gogh was given the name of his grandfather
        and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth.[note 2] Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh family.
        The name had been borne by his grandfather, the prominent art dealer Vincent (1789–1874), and a theology graduate at the
        University of Leiden in 1811. This Vincent had six sons, three of whom became art dealers, and may have been named after
        his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).[25]
        
        Van Gogh's mother came from a prosperous family in The Hague,[26] and his father was the youngest son of a minister.[27]
        The two met when Anna's younger sister, Cornelia, married Theodorus's older brother Vincent (Cent). Van Gogh's parents
        married in May 1851, and moved to Zundert.[28] His brother Theo was born on 1 May 1857. There was another brother, Cor,
        and three sisters: Elisabeth, Anna, and Willemina (known as "Wil"). In later life, Van Gogh remained in touch only with
        Willemina and Theo.[29] Van Gogh's mother was a rigid and religious woman who emphasized the importance of family to the
        point of for those around her.[30] Theodorus's salary as a minister was modest, but the Church also supplied the family
        with a house, a maid, two cooks, a gardener, a carriage and horse; his mother Anna instilled in the children a duty to
        uphold the family's high social position.[31]
        
        Van Gogh was a serious and thoughtful child.[32] He was taught at home by his mother and a governess, and in 1860, was
        sent to the village school. In 1864, he was placed in a boarding school at Zevenbergen,[33] where he felt abandoned, and
        he campaigned to come home. Instead, in 1866, his parents sent him to the middle school in Tilburg, where he was also
        deeply unhappy.[34] His interest in art began at a young age. He was encouraged to draw as a child by his mother,[35]
        and his early drawings are expressive,[33] but do not approach the intensity of his later work.[36] Constant Cornelis
        Huijsmans, who had been a successful artist in Paris, taught the students at Tilburg. His philosophy was to reject
        technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things, particularly nature or common objects. Van Gogh's profound
        unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons, which had little effect.[37] In March 1868, he abruptly returned
        home. He later wrote that his youth was "austere and cold, and sterile".[38]
        
        In July 1869, Van Gogh's uncle Cent obtained a position for him at the art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague.[39] After
        completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil's London branch on Southampton Street, and took lodgings
        at 87 Hackford Road, Stockwell.[40] This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work and, at 20, was
        earning more than his father. Theo's wife, Jo Van Gogh-Bonger, later remarked that this was the best year of Vincent's
        life. He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but she rejected him after confessing his
        feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated and religiously fervent. His father and
        uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues such as the degree to which the art
        dealers commodified art, and he was dismissed a year later.

<p>Van Gogh drew and painted with watercolours while at school, but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some
has been challenged.[219] When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level. In early 1882, his uncle,
Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague. Van
Gogh's work did not live up to expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in
detail, but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio
using variable shutters and different drawing materials. For more than a year he worked on single figures – highly
elaborate studies in black and white,[note 11] which at the time gained him only criticism. Later, they were recognised
as early masterpieces.[221]

In August 1882 Theo gave Vincent money to buy materials for working en plein air. Vincent wrote that he could now "go on
painting with new vigour".[222] From early 1883 he worked on multi-figure compositions. He had some of them
photographed, but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness, he destroyed them and turned to
oil painting. Van Gogh turned to well-known Hague School artists like Weissenbruch and Blommers, and he received
technical advice from them as well as from painters like De Bock and Van der Weele, both of the Hague School's second
generation.[223] He moved to Nuenen after a short period of time in Drenthe and began work on several large paintings
but destroyed most of them. The Potato Eaters and its companion pieces are the only ones to have survived.[223]
Following a visit to the Rijksmuseum Van Gogh wrote of his admiration for the quick, economical brushwork of the Dutch
Masters, especially Rembrandt and Frans Hals.[224][note 12] He was aware many of his faults were due to lack of
experience and technical expertise,[223] so in November 1885 he travelled to Antwerp and later Paris to learn and
develop his skills.[225]

Theo criticised The Potato Eaters for its dark palette, which he thought unsuitable for a modern style.[226] During Van
Gogh's stay in Paris between 1886 and 1887, he tried to master a new, lighter palette. His Portrait of Père Tanguy
(1887) shows his success with the brighter palette and is evidence of an evolving personal style.[227] Charles Blanc's
treatise on colour interested him greatly and led him to work with complementary colours. Van Gogh came to believe that
the effect of colour went beyond the descriptive; he said that "colour expresses something in itself".[228][229]
According to Hughes, Van Gogh perceived colour as having a "psychological and moral weight", as exemplified in the
garish reds and greens of The Night Café, a work he wanted to "express the terrible passions of humanity".[230] Yellow
meant the most to him, because it symbolised emotional truth. He used yellow as a symbol for sunlight, life, and
God.[231]

Van Gogh strove to be a painter of rural life and nature;[232] during his first summer in Arles he used his new palette
to paint landscapes and traditional rural life.[233] His belief that a power existed behind the natural led him to try
to capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols.[234] His
renditions of the sower, at first copied from Jean-François Millet, reflect the influence of Thomas Carlyle and
Friedrich Nietzsche's thoughts on the heroism of physical labour,[235] as well as Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the
sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun.[236] These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and
develop.[237] His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian iconography
he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life.[238] In Arles, having gained
confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint The Sower.[228]

Van Gogh stayed within what he called the "guise of reality"[239] and was critical of overly stylised works.[240] He
wrote afterwards that the abstraction of Starry Night had gone too far and that reality had "receded too far in the
background".[240] Hughes describes it as a moment of extreme visionary ecstasy: the stars are in a great whirl,
reminiscent of Hokusai's Great Wave, the movement in the heaven above is reflected by the movement of the cypress on the
earth below, and the painter's vision is "translated into a thick, emphatic plasma of paint".[241]

Between 1885 and his death in 1890, Van Gogh appears to have been building an oeuvre,[242] a collection that reflected
his personal vision and could be commercially successful. He was influenced by Blanc's definition of style, that a true
painting required optimal use of colour, perspective and brushstrokes. Van Gogh applied the word "purposeful" to
paintings he thought he had mastered, as opposed to those he thought of as studies.[243] He painted many series of
studies;[239] most of which were still lifes, many executed as colour experiments or as gifts to friends.[244] The work
in Arles contributed considerably to his oeuvre: those he thought the most important from that time were The Sower,
Night Cafe, Memory of the Garden in Etten and Starry Night. With their broad brushstrokes, inventive perspectives,
colours, contours and designs, these paintings represent the style he sought.</p>
