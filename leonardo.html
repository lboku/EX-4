    Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci[b] (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was
    active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect.[3] While his fame initially
    rested on his achievements as a painter, he also became known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on
    a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and paleontology. Leonardo is widely
    regarded to have been a genius who epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal,[4] and his collective works comprise a
    contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary, Michelangelo.[3][4]
    
    Born out of wedlock to a successful notary and a lower-class woman in, or near, Vinci, he was educated in Florence by
    the Italian painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio. He began his career in the city, but then spent much time in the
    service of Ludovico Sforza in Milan. Later, he worked in Florence and Milan again, as well as briefly in Rome, all while
    attracting a large following of imitators and students. Upon the invitation of Francis I, he spent his last three years
    in France, where he died in 1519. Since his death, there has not been a time where his achievements, diverse interests,
    personal life, and empirical thinking have failed to incite interest and admiration,[3][4] making him a frequent
    namesake and subject in culture.
    
    Leonardo is identified as one of the greatest painters in the history of art and is often credited as the founder of the
    High Renaissance.[3] Despite having many lost works and fewer than 25 attributed major works—including numerous
    unfinished works—he created some of the most influential paintings in Western art.[3] His magnum opus, the Mona Lisa, is
    his best known work and often regarded as the world's most famous painting. The Last Supper is the most reproduced
    religious painting of all time and his Vitruvian Man drawing is also regarded as a cultural icon. In 2017, Salvator
    Mundi, attributed in whole or part to Leonardo,[5] was sold at auction for US$450.3 million, setting a new record for
    the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.
    
    Revered for his technological ingenuity, he conceptualized flying machines, a type of armored fighting vehicle,
    concentrated solar power, a ratio machine that could be used in an adding machine,[6][7] and the double hull. Relatively
    few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime, as the modern scientific approaches to
    metallurgy and engineering were only in their infancy during the Renaissance. Some of his smaller inventions, however,
    entered the world of manufacturing unheralded, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile
    strength of wire. He made substantial discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, hydrodynamics, geology, optics, and
    tribology, but he did not publish his findings and they had little to no direct influence on subsequent science

        <p>In March 1513, Lorenzo de' Medici's son Giovanni assumed the papacy (as Leo X); Leonardo went to Rome that September,
        where he was received by the pope's brother Giuliano.[68] From September 1513 to 1516, Leonardo spent much of his time
        living in the Belvedere Courtyard in the Apostolic Palace, where Michelangelo and Raphael were both active.[67] Leonardo
        was given an allowance of 33 ducats a month, and according to Vasari, decorated a lizard with scales dipped in
        quicksilver.[70] The pope gave him a painting commission of unknown subject matter, but cancelled it when the artist set
        about developing a new kind of varnish.[70][m] Leonardo became ill, in what may have been the first of multiple strokes
        leading to his death.[70] He practiced botany in the Gardens of Vatican City, and was commissioned to make plans for the
        pope's proposed draining of the Pontine Marshes.[71] He also dissected cadavers, making notes for a treatise on vocal
        cords;[72] these he gave to an official in hopes of regaining the pope's favor, but was unsuccessful.[70]
        
        In October 1515, King Francis I of France recaptured Milan.[45] Leonardo was present at the 19 December meeting of
        Francis I and Leo X, which took place in Bologna.[33][73][74] In 1516, Leonardo entered Francis' service, being given
        the use of the manor house Clos Lucé, near the king's residence at the royal Château d'Amboise. Being frequently visited
        by Francis, he drew plans for an immense castle town the king intended to erect at Romorantin, and made a mechanical
        lion, which during a pageant walked toward the king and—upon being struck by a wand—opened its chest to reveal a cluster
        of lilies.[75][‡ 3][n] Leonardo was accompanied during this time by his friend and apprentice Francesco Melzi, and
        supported by a pension totalling 10,000 scudi.[67] At some point, Melzi drew a portrait of Leonardo; the only others
        known from his lifetime were a sketch by an unknown assistant on the back of one of Leonardo's studies (c. 1517)[77] and
        a drawing by Giovanni Ambrogio Figino depicting an elderly Leonardo with his right arm wrapped in clothing.[78][o] The
        latter, in addition to the record of an October 1517 visit by Louis d'Aragon,[p] confirms an account of Leonardo's right
        hand being paralytic when he was 65,[81] which may indicate why he left works such as the Mona Lisa
        unfinished.[79][82][83] He continued to work at some capacity until eventually becoming ill and bedridden for several
        months.[81]

<p>Despite the thousands of pages Leonardo left in notebooks and manuscripts, he scarcely made reference to his personal
life.[2]

Within Leonardo's lifetime, his extraordinary powers of invention, his "great physical beauty" and "infinite grace," as
described by Vasari,[‡ 5] as well as all other aspects of his life, attracted the curiosity of others. One such aspect
was his love for animals, likely including vegetarianism and according to Vasari, a habit of purchasing caged birds and
releasing them.[95][‡ 6]

Leonardo had many friends who are now notable either in their fields or for their historical significance, including
mathematician Luca Pacioli,[96] with whom he collaborated on the book Divina proportione in the 1490s. Leonardo appears
to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with Cecilia Gallerani and the two Este sisters,
Beatrice and Isabella.[97] While on a journey that took him through Mantua, he drew a portrait of Isabella that appears
to have been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.[33]

Beyond friendship, Leonardo kept his private life secret. His sexuality has been the subject of satire, analysis, and
speculation. This trend began in the mid-16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably by
Sigmund Freud in his Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood.[98] Leonardo's most intimate relationships were
perhaps with his pupils Salaì and Melzi. Melzi, writing to inform Leonardo's brothers of his death, described Leonardo's
feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate. It has been claimed since the 16th century that these
relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature. Court records of 1476, when he was aged twenty-four, show that Leonardo
and three other young men were charged with sodomy in an incident involving a well-known male prostitute. The charges
were dismissed for lack of evidence, and there is speculation that since one of the accused, Lionardo de Tornabuoni, was
related to Lorenzo de' Medici, the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal.[99] Since that date much has
been written about his presumed homosexuality[100] and its role in his art, particularly in the androgyny and eroticism
manifested in Saint John the Baptist and Bacchus and more explicitly in a number of erotic drawings.</p>
