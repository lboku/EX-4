    <p>Gustav Klimt (14 July 1862 – 6 February 1918) was an Austrian symbolist painter and one of the most prominent members of
    the Vienna Secession movement. Klimt is noted for his paintings, murals, sketches, and other objets d'art. Klimt's
    primary subject was the female body,[1] and his works are marked by a frank eroticism.[2] Amongst his figurative works,
    which include allegories and portraits, he painted landscapes. Among the artists of the Vienna Secession, Klimt was the
    most influenced by Japanese art and its methods.[citation needed]
    
    Early in his career, he was a successful painter of architectural decorations in a conventional manner. As he began to
    develop a more personal style, his work was the subject of controversy that culminated when the paintings he completed
    around 1900 for the ceiling of the Great Hall of the University of Vienna were criticized as pornographic. He
    subsequently accepted no more public commissions, but achieved a new success with the paintings of his "golden phase",
    many of which include gold leaf. Klimt's work was an important influence on his younger peer Egon Schiele.

        <p>Gustav Klimt was born in Baumgarten, near Vienna in the Austrian Empire, the second of seven children—three boys and
        four girls.[3] His mother, Anna Klimt (née Finster), had an unrealized ambition to be a musical performer. His father,
        Ernst Klimt the Elder, formerly from Bohemia, was a gold engraver.[4] All three of their sons displayed artistic talent
        early on. Klimt's younger brothers were Ernst Klimt and Georg Klimt.
        
        Klimt lived in poverty while attending the Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule, a school of applied arts and crafts, now the
        University of Applied Arts Vienna, where he studied architectural painting from 1876 until 1883.[4][5] He revered
        Vienna's foremost history painter of the time, Hans Makart. Klimt readily accepted the principles of a conservative
        training; his early work may be classified as academic.[4] In 1877 his brother, Ernst, who, like his father, would
        become an engraver, also enrolled in the school. The two brothers and their friend, Franz Matsch, began working together
        and by 1880 they had received numerous commissions as a team that they called the "Company of Artists". They also helped
        their teacher in painting murals in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.[4] Klimt began his professional career
        painting interior murals and ceilings in large public buildings on the Ringstraße, including a successful series of
        "Allegories and Emblems".
        
        In 1888 Klimt received the Golden Order of Merit from Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria for his contributions to murals
        painted in the Burgtheater in Vienna.[4] He also became an honorary member of the University of Munich and the
        University of Vienna. In 1892 Klimt's father and brother Ernst both died, and he had to assume financial responsibility
        for his father's and brother's families. The tragedies also affected his artistic vision and soon he would move towards
        a new personal style. Characteristic of his style at the end of the 19th century is the inclusion of Nuda Veritas (naked
        truth) as a symbolic figure in some of his works, including Ancient Greece and Egypt (1891), Pallas Athene (1898) and
        Nuda Veritas (1899).[6][7] Historians believe that Klimt with the nuda veritas denounced both the policy of the
        Habsburgs and Austrian society, which ignored all political and social problems of that time.[8] In the early 1890s
        Klimt met Austrian fashion designer Emilie Louise Flöge (a sibling of his sister-in-law) who was to be his companion
        until the end of his life. His painting, The Kiss (1907–08), is thought to be an image of them as lovers which was
        painted five years after Klimt's 1902 full-length portrait of her. He designed many costumes that she produced and
        modeled in his works.
        
        During this period Klimt fathered at least fourteen children.

<p>The only folio set produced in Klimt's lifetime, Das Werk Gustav Klimts, was published initially by H. O. Miethke (of
Gallerie Miethke, Klimt's exclusive gallery in Vienna) from 1908 to 1914 in an edition of 300, supervised personally by
the artist. The first thirty-five editions (I-XXXV) each included an original drawing by Klimt, and the next thirty-five
editions (XXXVI-LXX) each with a facsimile signature on the title page.[29] Fifty images depicting Klimt's most
important paintings (1893–1913) were reproduced using collotype lithography and mounted on a heavy, cream-colored wove
paper with deckle edges. Thirty-one of the images (ten of which are multicolored) are printed on Chine-collé. The
remaining nineteen are high quality halftones prints. Each piece was marked with a unique signet—designed by Klimt—which
was impressed into the wove paper in gold metallic ink. The prints were issued in groups of ten to subscribers, in
unbound black paper folders embossed with Klimt's name. Because of the delicate nature of collotype lithography, as well
as the necessity for multicolored prints (a feat difficult to reproduce with collotypes), and Klimt's own desire for
perfection, the series that was published in mid-1908 was not completed until 1914.[30]

Each of the fifty prints was categorized among five themes:

Allegorical (which included multicolored prints of The Golden Knight, 1903 and The Virgin, c. 1912)
Erotic-Symbolist (Water Serpents I and Water Serpents II, both c. 1907–08 and The Kiss, c. 1908)
Landscapes (Farm Garden with Sunflowers, 1907)
Mythical or Biblical (Pallas Athena, 1898; Judith and The Head of Holofernes, 1901; and Danaë, c. 1908)
Portraits (Emilie Flöge, 1902)
The monochrome collotypes as well as the halftone works were printed with a variety of colored inks ranging from sepia
to blue and green. Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria was the first to purchase a folio set of Das Werk Gustav Klimts in
1908.

Fünfundzwanzig Handzeichnungen
Fünfundzwanzig Handzeichnungen ("Twenty-five Drawings") was released the year after Klimt's death. Many of the drawings
in the collection were erotic in nature and just as polarizing as his painted works. Published in Vienna in 1919 by
Gilhofer & Ranschburg, the edition of 500 features twenty-five monochrome and two-color collotype reproductions, nearly
indistinguishable from the original works. While the set was released a year after Klimt's death, some art historians
suspect he was involved with production planning because of the meticulous nature of the printing (Klimt had overseen
the production of the plates for Das Werk Gustav Klimts, making sure each one was to his exact specifications, a level
of quality carried through similarly in Fünfundzwanzig Handzeichnungen). The first ten editions also each contained an
original Klimt drawing.[31]

Many of the works contained in this volume depict erotic scenes of nude women, some of whom are masturbating alone or
are coupled in sapphic embraces.[32][33] When a number of the original drawings were exhibited to the public, at
Gallerie Miethke in 1910 and the International Exhibition of Prints and Drawings in Vienna in 1913, they were met by
critics and viewers who were hostile towards Klimt's contemporary perspective. There was an audience for Klimt's erotic
drawings, however, and fifteen of his drawings were selected by Viennese poet Franz Blei for his translation of
Hellenistic satirist Lucian's Dialogues of the Courtesans. The book, limited to 450 copies, provided Klimt the
opportunity to show these more lurid depictions of women and avoided censorship thanks to an audience composed of a
small group of (mostly male) affluent patrons.</p>
